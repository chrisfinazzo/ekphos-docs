import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';

Ekphos supports standard markdown plus wiki links and other enhancements.

## Headings

All six heading levels are supported with distinct styling:

```markdown
# Heading 1    ▼/▶ blue, bold, uppercase (foldable)
## Heading 2   ▼/▶ green, bold (foldable)
### Heading 3  ▼/▶ yellow, bold (foldable)
#### Heading 4 › magenta, bold
##### Heading 5   teal, bold
###### Heading 6  subtle, italic
```

### Heading Folding

H1-H3 headings can be folded to collapse their content, creating a cleaner workspace for long documents.

**Fold indicators**:
- `▼` Expanded (children visible)
- `▶` Folded (children hidden)

**Keybindings in Content View**:
- `Space` or click to toggle fold on a heading
- `za` vim-style toggle fold
- `zM` fold all headings
- `zR` unfold all headings

When folded, all content until the next heading of equal or higher level is hidden.

<Callout>
Only H1-H3 appear in the outline panel for navigation and support folding.
</Callout>

## Text Formatting

```markdown
**bold text**
*italic text*
~~strikethrough~~
`inline code`
> blockquote
```

## Lists

### Unordered

```markdown
- Item one
- Item two
  - Nested item
* Also works with asterisks
```

### Ordered

```markdown
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
```

### Task Lists

```markdown
- [ ] Unchecked task
- [x] Completed task
- [ ] Task with [[wiki link]]
- [ ] Task with [markdown link](https://example.com)
- [ ] Task with ![image](screenshot.png)
- [ ] Task with !![text-only image](diagram.png)
```

Tasks are interactive - press `Space` in content view to toggle the checkbox.

**Tasks with links**: When a task contains links (wikilinks, markdown links, or images), use `]` / `[` to navigate between the checkbox and links. `Space` toggles the checkbox when it's selected, or opens the link when a link is selected.

**Smart image rendering**:
- **Standalone images** (`![](path)` on its own line): Render at full content width with border
- **Inline images** (in lists, tasks, or with other text): Render as compact thumbnails below the text

All images can be opened with `Space` or `Enter` when selected.

## Links

### Markdown Links

```markdown
[Link text](https://example.com)
```

Press `Space` to open in browser. Use `]` and `[` to navigate between multiple links on the same line.

### Wiki Links

Obsidian-style linking between notes:

```markdown
[[note name]]
[[folder/nested note]]
[[note name|display text]]
[[note name#heading]]
[[note name#heading|display text]]
```

**Syntax**:

| Format | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `[[note]]` | Basic link to note |
| `[[note\|alias]]` | Link with custom display text |
| `[[note#heading]]` | Link to specific heading in note |
| `[[note#heading\|alias]]` | Heading link with custom display text |

**Features**:
- Valid links shown in cyan
- Invalid links shown in red
- Type `[[` in edit mode for autocomplete
- Creates non-existent notes on navigation
- Aliases display the custom text instead of note name
- Heading links navigate to the specified section

**Recursive Search**:

Wiki links use recursive search to find notes in any subdirectory, similar to Obsidian. `[[note]]` will find a note named "note" even if it's located in a nested folder like `folder/subfolder/note.md`. Root-level notes are matched first for backwards compatibility.

The autocomplete popup shows the note title with a subtle folder path hint below for nested notes, making it easy to identify where each note is located while keeping wikilinks clean and simple.

## Code Blocks

Fenced code blocks with syntax highlighting:

````markdown
```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, ekphos!");
}
```
````

### Supported Languages

50+ languages via syntect:

Rust, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, C, C++, Java, Ruby, PHP, Shell, SQL, HTML, CSS, JSON, YAML, and many more.

## Tables

```markdown
| Header 1 | Header 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   |
| Cell 3   | Cell 4   |
```

Tables render with proper borders and header styling.

## Images

```markdown
![Alt text](image.png)
![Remote](https://example.com/image.jpg)
```

**Supported formats**: PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, BMP

**Features**:
- Local and remote URLs
- Inline preview in compatible terminals
- Click, press `Enter`, or `o` to open in system viewer

### Supported Path Types

| Path Type | Example | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Relative | `![](image.png)` | Resolved relative to the current note's directory |
| Relative with ./ | `![](./assets/img.png)` | Explicit relative path |
| Home directory | `![](~/Pictures/photo.jpg)` | Expands `~` to user's home directory |
| Absolute | `![](/Users/name/img.png)` | Full filesystem path |
| Remote URL | `![](https://example.com/img.jpg)` | HTTP/HTTPS URLs |

<Callout>
Relative paths are resolved from the markdown file's location, not the current working directory.
</Callout>

### Compatible Terminals

For inline image preview:
- iTerm2 (macOS)
- Kitty
- WezTerm
- Ghostty
- Sixel-enabled terminals

### Text-only Image Links

Use double-bang syntax `!![]()` to display an image as a text link without preview:

```markdown
!![Alt text](image.png)
!![](screenshot.png)
```

**Behavior**:
- Displays as plain text (alt text or path) instead of image preview
- No thumbnail rendering in lists or tasks
- Still navigable with `]` / `[`
- Still openable with `Space` or `Enter`

**Use cases**:
- Reference images without cluttering the view
- Link to images in terminals without image support
- Keep notes compact while preserving image links

## Collapsible Sections

HTML details/summary for expandable content:

```html
<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

Hidden content here.

</details>
```

Press `Space` to toggle in content view.

## Horizontal Rules

```markdown
---
***
___
```
